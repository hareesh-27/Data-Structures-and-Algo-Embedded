## **Inter integrated circuit**

- It has 2 lines SDA and SCL, serial data line and serial clock line respectively
- These 2 lines are used for communication
- Initial state of both lines are high with the help of 2 pullup resistors.(Not mandatory though)
- Works in master-slave method

**2 cases** here,
             **- **Master sends data to slave****
             **- Master reads data from slave**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Master sends data to slave**
  - Normally, SDA and SCL both are high. First a start bit is sent **logic 0**

  - 1st, master will send start bit **logic 0** by pulling SDA low.
  - Now, master sends the address of the slave that it wants to communicate with on the SDA line.
  - Next, master sends read/write bit. Our case, it is write bit so **logic 0**
  - After this, slave give acknowledgement by giving ack bit. **logic 0** means it is ready for comm
  - Now, data will be sent by master to slave
  - Another ack bit by slave to confirm data transfer
  - Finally stop bit **logic 0** by master. After this both SDA and SCL goes high

## I2C arbitration and stretching

### I2C arbitration
This happens when **2 devices** try to take control over the bus.

![I2C Arbitration](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c596de12-b287-49ba-84ac-01c2887a5460)

- Here 2 devices try to control the bus  
- Before explaining I2C arbitration, we need to remember that I2C is a **wired AND logic**  
  - Initially both SDA and SCL are HIGH  
  - Devices cannot drive HIGH, only pull LOW or release  
  - If device B pulls LOW → line becomes LOW (**wired AND**)  

- So, the device which sends **0** controls the line  
- This is called **arbitration**
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I2C Clock Stretching

- Clock stretching is used when the **slave is not ready** to continue communication.

- In I2C:
  - Master generates the clock (**SCL**)  
  - But slave can **hold SCL LOW**

- Working:
  - Master tries to make SCL HIGH  
  - Slave keeps SCL LOW → clock is paused  
  - Master must **wait**  
  - Once slave releases SCL → communication continues  

- Reason:
  - Slave needs time to:
    - Process data  
    - Prepare next byte  
    - Perform internal operations  

- Important points:
  - Only **SCL is stretched**, not SDA  
  - Based on **wired AND logic**  
    - If any device pulls LOW → line stays LOW  
  - Master cannot force SCL HIGH  

- Result:
  - No data loss ✅  
  - Synchronization maintained ✅  

- In short:
  - Slave temporarily **controls timing**
